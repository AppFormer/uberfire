# What is Uberfire
UberFire is a web framework for a superior experience in building extensible workbenches and console type applications

It provides an Eclipse like workbench experience for the web, helping you to make maintainable, customizable workbench-style apps in no time flat.

Our ultimate goal in Uberfire is to provide a strong ecosystem around it, based on a rich set of pluggable components and a strong infrastructure, allowing different type of users easily build Rich Web Apps on top of it.

Uberfire is the technology behind of Drools and jBPM web tooling and based on challenges and lessons learned during the workbench development of these projects.
