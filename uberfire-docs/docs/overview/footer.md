# Footer
Footers in Uberfire are automatically discovered via CDI and added to the bottom of the Workbench screen. They stick
to the bottom of the viewport even when the main content area is scrolled up and down or the browser window is resized.

In order to create a footer you have to create a CDI bean that implements org.uberfire.client.workbench.Footer interface.
